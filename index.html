Implementing Memcached to improve your application’s performance can be done fairly quickly without using Zend Framework. If you’re just wanting Memcached, skip Zend Framework (and probably this post). On the other hand, if you’re using Zend Framework but you’re not using Memcached, this will help you get things going. But whatever your situation

Taken straight from the Memcached website, “Memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system”. In other words, Memcached helps you increase application perfomance by caching data in memory. Using Memcached to load data instead of a database or file system can have a major impact on your applications performance. (Insert meaningless benchmark term such as “ten-fold” here.) The best part is these benefits only increase as load increases, so you get increase scalability for free.</span></div>

Recent versions of Safari and Opera implement CSS Media Queries, a specification that is still in development at the W3C. CSS Media Queries offer more than the simple list of CSSMedia Types. They allow authors to customize a style sheet based on some well-known properties, such as the size of the screen that is rendering the page.

As an example, the following specifies a style sheet to be used by the iPhone’s browser and not any PC browser using (as presented by Craig Hockenberry in A List Apart):
How browsers behave

The following table summarizes how various popular mobile web browsers behave today. Most of the information comes from the raw data that W3C’s mobile test harness collects on how mobile browsers react to CSS media types and media queries.</span></div>

              <div class="quote"><span class="user">schmkr</span>: <span class="description">Input Filtering and Forms
In most cases, you want your model to perform its own input filtering. The reason is because input filtering is domain logic: it&#039;s the set of rules that define what input is valid, and how to normalize that input.

However, how does that fit in with forms? Zend Framework has a Zend_Form component, which allows you to specify your validation and filter chains, as well as rules for how to render the form via decorators. The typical pattern is to define a form, and in your controller, pass input to it; if it validates, you then pass the values to the model.

What if you were to instead attach the form to the model?

Some argue that this violates the concept of &quot;separation of concerns&quot;, due to the fact that it mixes rendering logic into the model. I feel this is a pedantic argument. When attached to a form, Zend_Form can be used strictly as an input filter; you would pull the form from the model when you wish to render it, and perform any view-specific actions...</span></div>

A daemon is a Linux program that run in the background, just like a &#039;Service&#039; on Windows. It can perform all sorts of tasks that do not require direct user input. Apache is a daemon, so is MySQL. All you ever hear from them is found in somewhere in /var/log, yet they silently power over 40% of the Internet.

You reading this page, would not have been possible without them. So clearly: a daemon is a powerful thing, and can be bend to do a lot of different tasks.</span></div>

              <div class="quote"><span class="user">schmkr</span>: <span class="description">Today I added an object storage implementation that uses Apache CouchDB as its backend.
Apache CouchDB, the distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free document-oriented database that provides scalability as a consequence of its design, is a natural fit for such an object store.
The following example shows how the Object_Freezer&#039;s new backend for CouchDB can be used to persist PHP objects:
Here is an overview of the current feature set:
    * PHP objects, with the exception of objects of &quot;special&quot; classes such as Closure or PDO, can be frozen and thawed.
    * Graphs of objects, including those that contain circular references, are supported.
    * Frozen objects can be stored in and fetched from an Apache CouchDB database.
One thing that I want to do before I am comfortable with making a first release is to rewrite the hashing of objects that is used for dirty object detection.
    * PHP objects, with the exception of objects of &quot;special&quot; classes such as Closure or PDO, can be froze..</span></div>

              <div class="quote"><span class="user">schmkr</span>: <span class="description">In this post, I&#039;ll discuss using Access Control Lists (ACLs) as part of your modelling strategy.

ACLs are used to indicate who has access to do what on a given resource. In the paradigm I will put forward, your resource is your model, and the what are the various methods of the model. If you finesse a bit, you&#039;ll have &quot;user&quot; objects that act as your who.

Just like with forms, you want to put your ACLs as close to your domain logic as possible; in fact, ACLs are part of your domain.

First up, however, let&#039;s review Zend_Acl.
Zend_Acl in a Nutshell

Zend_Acl is divided into three areas of responsibility:

    * Resources are objects to which access is controlled
    * Roles are objects which may request access to one or more resources
    * ACLs provide a tree structure to which resources and roles may be added, and which map access rules between them.</span></div>

Although all browsers implement roughly the same set of baseline features, there is relatively little standardization - or conformance to standards - when it comes to many of the less apparent implementation details.

(or at least you should have!) If you haven&#039;t, you can give it a quick read to understand what Zend_Tool offers. If you want have it installed on your system without any hassle, install it via the PEAR installer (blog post about the PEAR installation and what&#039;s offered here).

After you&#039;ve had a chance to play with Zend_Tool in some depth though, you are bound to start asking the question &quot;how do I extend Zend_Tool?&quot; Which is exactly we&#039;ll cover in the following article.
In order to understand how to extend Zend_Tool, you need to know a few things about its overall structure. The whole of the system was built with extensibility in mind. Each of the major functional parts of the system are abstracted in such a way that its easy to not only extend, but to replace with completely separate implementations. For example, our initial interface to this system is a...</span></div>

It&#039;s the place you find yourself in when you complete a few tutorials and scan through the Reference Guide, where you are buried in knowledge up to your neck but without a clue about how to bind it all together effectively into an application. This take on the Zend Framework offers a survival guide, boosting your understanding of the framework and how it all fits together by following the development of a single application from start to finish. I&#039;ll even throw in a few bad jokes for free.

The book is a work in progress and will soon be available to read online or download and print as PDF. In fact, every individual chapter can be downloaded individually or read online as soon as it&#039;s published. There will be no final version of the book - it&#039;s not like Zend will cease releasing new Zend Framework versions tomorrow! There will be a print edition in the near future when I figure out how that should work.</span></div>

REST is an architectural style, or set of conventions, for web applications and services that centers itself around resource manipulation and the HTTP spec. Web apps have traditionally ignored the HTTP spec and moved forward using a subset of the protocol: GET and POST, 200 OKs and 404 NOT FOUNDs. As we entered a programmable web of applications with APIs the decision to ignore HTTP gave us problems we’re still dealing with today. We have an internet full of applications with different interfaces (GET /user/1/delete vs. POST /user/delete {id=1}). With REST we can say /user/1 is a resource and use the HTTP DELETE verb to delete it. For more detail on REST check out wikipedia and “quick pitch“.</span></div>

              <div class="quote"><span class="user">markoj</span>: <span class="description">The same way tabbed browsing revolutionized the web experience, GNU Screen can do the same for your experience in the command line. GNU Screen allows you to manage several interactive shell instances within the same “window.” By using different keyboard shortcuts, you are able to shuffle through the shell instances, access any of them directly, create new ones, kill old ones, attach and detach existing ones.

Instead of opening up several terminal instances on your desktop or using those ugly GNOME/KDE-based tabs, Screen can do it better and simpler.

Not only that, with GNU Screen, you can share sessions with others and detach/attach terminal sessions. It is a great tool for people who have to share working environments between work and home.

By adding a status bar to your screen environment, you are able to name your shell instances on the fly or via a configuration file called .screenrc that can be created on the user’s home directory.</span></div>

Many tutorials suggest that you set up the Zend AMF server directly in the bootstrap or index.php file. But what if you want to build a hybrid application with both Flex and HTML interfaces? In this case it’s better to let the bootstrap file do its usual job of application dispatching, and to make the AMF gateway a controller.

Introducing the Gateway Controller

Setting up a Zend AMF server inside a Zend controller is pretty easy:</span></div>

              <div class="quote"><span class="user">schmkr</span>: <span class="description">The Model is a complex subject. However, it is often boiled down to either a single model class or a full object relational mapping (ORM). I personally have never been much of a fan of ORMs as they tie models to the underlying database structure; I don&#039;t always use a database, nor do I want to rely on an ORM solution too heavily on the off-chance that I later need to refactor to use services or another type of persistence store. On the other hand, the model as a single class is typically too simplistic.

When you think in these terms, you start breaking your system into discrete pieces that you need to manipulate, as well as consider how each piece relates to the others. This type of exercise also helps you stop thinking of your model in terms of database tables; instead, your database becomes the container in which data is persisted from one use of your model to the next. Your model instead is an object that can do things with either incoming or stored data -- or even completely...</span></div>

Information Architecture is the discipline dealing with the modern version of this problem: how to organize web sites so that users actually can find what they are looking for.

Information architects have so far applied known and well-tried tools from library science to solve this problem, and now topic maps are sailing up as another potential tool for information architects. This raises the question of how topic maps compare with the traditional solutions, and that is the question this paper attempts to address.

The paper argues that topic maps go beyond the traditional solutions in the sense that it provides a framework within which they can be represented as they are, but also extended in ways which significantly improve information retrieval.</span></div>

              <div class="quote"><span class="user">Haschek</span>: <span class="description"># You can use 24-bit alpha-translucent PNG images for the background-image CSS property in Internet Explorer 6.
# Support for background-position and background-repeat. Apparently, Angus of TwinHelix has also figured out a way!
# You can use PNGs for &lt;IMG/&gt; elements, which is nothing new, but you don&#039;t need a 1px by 1px clear GIF image, which is new.
# There is no usage of AlphaImageLoader, so this doesn&#039;t have the buggy z-indexing associated with that filter.
# Responds to Javascript element.style assignments and the :hover pseudo-class.</span></div>

              <div class="quote"><span class="user">schmkr</span>: <span class="description">One of the nicest features to have when you are developing an application is a decent debug console so that you can see what your application is doing without having to look through ten log files and put var_dumps that you have to comment out all through your code. In the Zend Framework v1.6 we get a new feature based on FirePHP which will allow us to log directly to the Firebug console with a simple API call from PHP. Here is an example of how this looks in my application:
It&#039;s actually pretty easy to get this working, I did have to make one change to the Wildfire library though when I first started using it in order to get it behaving as I expected. I opened a bug which was resolved before 1.6 rolled out the door. In setting this up, I wanted the debugging to be as transparent as possible, one of the great things about Zend_Log is the ability to add filters to the individual writers so that the main log writer that writes things out to a file can ignore log messages with a priorit...</span></div>
